# 🔧 Admin Role Solution Guide

## 📋 **Current Issue**

Your admin user (`admin@pro.com`) currently has the role `OPERATIONS_MANAGER` instead of `admin`. The authorization middleware is working correctly but denying access because `OPERATIONS_MANAGER` is not recognized as having admin privileges.

## 🎯 **Solution Options**

### **Option 1: Update User Role in Database (Recommended)**

**Step 1: Update the admin user's role to `admin`**

You can do this by:

1. **Using MongoDB Compass/Atlas:**
   ```javascript
   // Find and update the user
   db.users.updateOne(
     { email: "admin@pro.com" },
     { 
       $set: { 
         role: "admin",
         permissions: ["admin"]
       }
     }
   )
   ```

2. **Using the provided script:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure your .env has the correct MONGODB_URI
   node scripts/update_admin_role_remote.js
   ```

**Step 2: Test the fix**
   ```bash
   node test_admin_fixed.js
   ```

### **Option 2: Update Authorization Middleware**

**Step 1: Update the middleware to recognize OPERATIONS_MANAGER as admin**
   ```bash
   node update_middleware_for_operations_manager.js
   ```

**Step 2: Restart your backend server**
   ```bash
   # Stop current server and restart
   node start-backend.js
   ```

**Step 3: Test the fix**
   ```bash
   node test_admin_fixed.js
   ```

## 🔍 **Expected Results After Fix**

After implementing either solution, you should see:

```
✅ Login successful!
👤 User: System Administrator
🎭 Role: admin (or OPERATIONS_MANAGER with admin privileges)

✅ Get All Users: Access granted
✅ Get All Customers: Access granted
✅ Create Customer: Access granted
✅ Get All Orders: Access granted
✅ Create Order: Access granted
✅ Get All Reports: Access granted
```

## 📊 **Role Permission Matrix**

| **Role** | **Users** | **Customers** | **Orders** | **Reports** | **Vehicles** |
|----------|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| `admin` | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All |
| `GENERAL_MANAGER` | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All |
| `OPERATIONS_MANAGER` | ❌ (needs fix) | ❌ (needs fix) | ✅ Read/Write | ❌ (needs fix) | ✅ Read |
| `employee` | ❌ | ✅ Read/Write | ✅ Read/Write | ✅ Read | ✅ Read/Write |

## 🛠️ **Quick Fix Commands**

### **If you have database access:**
```bash
# Update user role in database
node scripts/update_admin_role_remote.js

# Test the fix
node test_admin_fixed.js
```

### **If you want to update middleware:**
```bash
# Update middleware
node update_middleware_for_operations_manager.js

# Restart server
# (stop current server and run: node start-backend.js)

# Test the fix
node test_admin_fixed.js
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If login still fails:**
1. Check if the user exists in the database
2. Verify the password is correct
3. Ensure the user is active (`isActive: true`)

### **If authorization still fails:**
1. Check the user's role in the database
2. Verify the middleware is updated correctly
3. Restart the backend server after changes

### **If database connection fails:**
1. Check your `MONGODB_URI` in `.env` file
2. Ensure the database is accessible
3. Verify network connectivity

## 📝 **Summary**

The issue is that your admin user has the role `OPERATIONS_MANAGER` instead of `admin`. You have two options:

1. **Change the user's role** to `admin` in the database
2. **Update the middleware** to treat `OPERATIONS_MANAGER` as admin

Both solutions will work, but updating the user role is cleaner and follows the intended design.
